# üö¶ Adaptive Traffic Simulation (Pygame)

This project demonstrates a comparison between **Fixed Timer Traffic Lights** and **Adaptive (Fuzzy Logic-based) Traffic Lights** using Python and Pygame.  
It shows how adaptive signals can reduce congestion and clear more vehicles compared to fixed timers.

---

## üéÆ Features
- **Two Models** side-by-side:
  - **Fixed Timer** (constant green duration).
  - **Adaptive Timer (Fuzzy Logic)** (green time adjusts based on vehicle count).
- Vehicle animation with real-time counts.
- Statistics panel comparing:
  - Cars cleared
  - Total wait time
  - Average wait time
- Simple UI with Pygame (press **SPACEBAR** to start).
